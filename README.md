Jeff Lile's Code Louisville Horse Racing Project

September 2020 Front End Web Development Class

My project is a one page website that allows you to place a bet on one of three horses. It will indicate to you if you entered an invalid input and whether you chose the winner or loser. You can see the odds of the horses and some information about them. You are welcome to try to pick a winner over and over as the project resets after each race.

Project Requirements Met

1) A hamburger menu was used on mobile devices.
2) Flexbox is used in the navigation menus and body content.
