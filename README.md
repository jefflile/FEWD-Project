# Jeff Lile's Code Louisville Horse Racing Project

September 2020 Front End Web Development Class

My project is a one page website (index.html) that can be found at https://jefflile.github.io/. It allows you to place a bet on one of three horses. It will indicate to you if you entered an invalid input and whether you chose the winner or loser. You can see the odds of the horses and some information about them. You are welcome to try to pick a winner over and over as the project resets after each race.

## Project Requirements Met

### CSS

1. A hamburger menu was used on mobile devices.
2. Flexbox is used in the navigation menus and body content.
3. Used :nth-child on the list of horses in the Current Horse Odds section.
4. Media queries are used to change how content is presented on different screen sizes.

### Javascript

1. Create a form that validates for a correct number value.
2. Display pop ups for messages that are conveyed to the user.
3. The winner of the horse races are chosen at random using Math.random and an array.
4. Accordions are used for the horse information in the About the Horses section that expand or collapse when clicked.

If you are a video game fan, enter the one video game cheat code to rule them all for a secret.
